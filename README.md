Absolutely! I'll update your README to specifically highlight the **custom modifications** you've recently added to the repository — like GSAP > Framer Motion switch in some places, futuristic UIs, UI glow effects, animated text, ScrollStack integration, 3D styling, etc.

### ✅ Updated README HIGHLIGHTING Your Custom Enhancements

# MLSC VCET Website — Official Documentation

## 🚀 Overview

This is the official repository for the **Microsoft Learn Student Club (MLSC) VCET Website**.  
The site has evolved far beyond a standard React site:

✅ We refactored multiple sections with **Framer Motion** in place of GSAP for smoother, native React animations.  
✅ Introduced **dynamic futuristic card designs** using Glassmorphism with neon glow, pulse border effects, and 3D hover tilt.  
✅ Added **text animations** using custom components like `SplitText`, `ScrambledText`, `ShinyText`, and `TextType`.  
✅ Implemented **ScrollStack parallax behavior** for layered scroll depth.  
✅ Used **Shiny cursor fluid splash effect** with WebGL.  
✅ Event and Project sections now load with animation when scrolled into view using `whileInView` + stagger.  
✅ Navbar and card components now use hover glow, bounce, and blur for modern UI user experience.  
✅ Option to integrate Three.js for 3D events gallery (experimental).
